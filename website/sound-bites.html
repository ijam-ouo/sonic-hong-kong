        <h2>Welcome to <i>Sound Bites</i></h2>
        <p>
          Cantonese, the mother tongue spoken in Hong Kong, is one of the most
          tonally complex languages of the world. It makes up a quintessential
          soundscape of Hong Kongers with their jovial expressions and musical
          tonalities. Sound Bites, a community based research project of HKBU,
          explores the expressive soundscape of Cantonese language, and the Hong
          Kongers' affection for this special language.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an intimate and profound heritage of human cultures, language is
          expressive of personalities of a culture, its people, and its history.
          <i>Sound Bites</i> invite you to share your unique perspectives and
          experiences through short interviews. Your answers will be collected
          for research purposes. Additionally, your audios might be showcased in
          an <i>expressive output</i>. Please express yourself freely and
          personally!
